Ive accomplished most of my goals on some level. I wanted to play professional basketball,although ive never made it to the NBA I still  played for years overseas, also state side.I wanted to travel the world and experience things no one could ever imagine. I made that dream come true with the military, traveling was small on that list of experiences. Still i reach that mark. One thing i loved a kid was computers but never wanted to be seen as a nerd especially being on all sport teams. Ive gotten to a place where my image to the world no longer matters, just my family and myself happiness. So i revisited my computer, Steven Hawkins, coding the next space time continuum dream like i  never forgot it. Also the opportunities are limitless. I can also work from home with some companies and spend more time with my kids.
